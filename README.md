# Mass-XML-Language-Translator
A mass translator for XML formats in a specific directory

Usage:
The Python code in the source folder will search for text tags in all XML files in /data/XMLs and send requests to the Google Translate API for translation.

The source and destination languages are determined when the code starts.

Each time the code processes a file, it.  Then, each thread will process and save the result. Therefore, make a backup of your files before running the code.
